# Overflow

Creating the game application. There would be several gaming modes in this application.
The main idea - the player have an empty vessel with the mark on it. This mark shows the limit value for liquid in this vessel.
The player could fill this vessel with water until the watering mark in several game modes:
1. By choosing flowing the lesser vessels with water to the main vessel
2. By filling by tap the main vessel using unlimited flow of water
The more water will be in the vessel - the more points player would get.
If the player overflows the vessel - all scored points in the round would be lost.
After 3 overflows - the game will end, with ability to place their score to the leaderboard
